            building new things, with my 3D printer I am able to create anything that I can imagine, and one day, just
            staring at a potentiometer I thought, "Um, maybe there is some way to build a steering wheel out of one of
            those?". And from that thought, this project born, made with a 3D printer, an arduino, a potentiometer, and
            some wires, it came to live.

        <h1 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-10 place-self-center">What I learned</h1>
        <p class="text-md sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-justify">The first thing I got better was in CAD, where I use
            fusion 360 to be able to model all the parts I needed. With everything modeled, I had to 3D print them,
            another skill I got to get better, with this projects, I was able to play around with infill patterns and
            percentage as well as supports.
            <br>
            <br>
            One thing that I was pretty bad (and I still am :P) is soldering, which was something I had to work on as
            well in this project, soldering the arduino pro micro pins was really a challenge for me, but, after 3 pins
            wasted and lots of tries, I got it right :D
            <br>
            <br>
            The last thing was just assembling everything, using zip ties to pack the wires tightly, securing the
            potentiometer in place and coding it. For the coding part I used C++ with the library Joystick.h, that
            really accelerated my project, with around 30 lines of codes and some tries it was already working.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also, this project is a mark because it's the first video I ever post on youtube, I don't know how this
            channel will turn out, I just posted the video this week but I hope to inspire more people to join this
            incredible field that is Engineering.
