            controlled car I
            made for a school project, we were asked to do an electric car using a battery, some motors and wires. I
            wanted to go beyond that and create a really cool project, so, using a PS3 controller with a
            microcontroller, I made my car remote controlled. As an addicional, I also used some infrared sensors to
            make it a line follower.

        <p class="text-md sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-justify">This was one of the first projects that got me into this
            world of engineering, with it, I understood embedded
            programming in microcontrollers using the language C, I used the bluetooth module that's already integrated
            into the esp32 chip to connect the car to the PS3 controller. From there, it was really simple, I just had
            to take the input from the controller joystick and translate that to the motors spin, so for example, if the
            user pushed the joystick forwards, I just had to spin the corresponding motor forwards too. So, as I said
            before, I put a line follower as an extra feature, then, if you press the square button on the controller it
            turned the line follower on/off. To make it work, I used some infrared sensors that could "see" if the color
            behind it is light or dark, so, the ESP32 makes the calculation and set the motors speed to the one that
            would make it go straight in the black line.

            <p class="text-md sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-justify">
                One of the biggest challenges was making the PS3 controller communicate properly with the ESP32 via
                Bluetooth. I had to use some libraries that weren't well documented, but at the end I could figure it
                out by changing the MAC address of the controller, and setting the microcontroller to connect to this
                exact same address. Another challenge was to make it turn smoothly in the curves, but I could manage to
                solve it too doing some calculations to set the turn speed proportional to its misalignment.
